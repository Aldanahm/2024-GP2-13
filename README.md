A Flutter project.

## Getting Started


**Project Title: InnerJoy**

**Description:**
Our project aims to tackle the problems that people with mental health face by leveraging technology to create a comprehensive and user-friendly solution. We achieved this by crafting an application that integrates:
- A chatbot that acts as a friendly virtual companion who is always there to lend a listening ear.
- A thorough assessment tool that integrates a dynamic form/questionnaire to measure users' mental health status, serving as a personalized starting point towards the right resources and support.
- An option to send timely notifications to remind and encourage users.
- A weekly progress email to keep users updated with their plan and achievements.

**Goal:**
By combining AI, CBT, and thoughtful UX/UI design, we aspire to bridge the gap mentioned by the Saudi Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institutions (CBAHI). Our application seeks to provide personalized, stigma-free support that meets individuals wherever they are on their mental health journey. In doing so, we endeavor to make a positive impact on countless individuals, making mental health support more inclusive, accessible, and effective.

**Technology:**
- **Flutter** (Dart programming language)
- **VS Code** IDE for development
- **Firebase** for handling the database
- **PalmAPI** for the chatbot
- **Google Cloud** to handle email sending for weekly progress
